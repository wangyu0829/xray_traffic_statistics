# Work Log
After completing each step, record your work log in the ProjectStatus.md file.
Answer the following questions step by step without omitting any information: What functions have we implemented? What errors have we encountered? How did we solve these errors? Was the execution successful or not?
And when each task is completed, review and organize the relevant content, and write it as a note in the Progress.md file. Clean up the content related to old tasks if necessary. First, describe the task, and then plan the steps required to complete the task. You can use to - do markers to indicate the progress, for example:
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
After completing a subtask, also update the task progress in the notepad.
Especially when you complete a milestone, using the notepad for reflection and planning can help improve the depth of your task completion.
The purpose of doing this is to help you grasp the overall situation and the task progress. Be sure to refer to the notepad when planning the next step.

# Experience Accumulation
During the interaction with users, if you find any reusable content in this project (such as library versions, model names), especially the repair methods for mistakes you made or the corrective opinions you received, you should record them in the Lesson.md file. Always read the content of this file at the beginning of each task to avoid making the same mistakes again.

# Project Progress Record
The Progress.md file is your notepad. You need to read the relevant content at the beginning of each task as the context for the current task.`
